# Claiming Winnings

## When Markets Resolve
After the event occurs and the market end time passes, the market is resolved to either YES or NO.

## Checking Resolution Status
1. Navigate to the market page
2. Look for the **Resolved** badge
3. Check which outcome won

## How to Claim

### Step 1: View Resolved Markets
Go to **My Positions** and filter by "Resolved"

### Step 2: Identify Winning Positions
Markets where you hold winning shares will show "Claim Available"

### Step 3: Click Claim
Click the **Claim Winnings** button

### Step 4: Confirm Transaction
Approve the transaction in your wallet

### Step 5: Receive Payout
Winnings are sent directly to your wallet

## Payout Calculation
- Each winning share = $1.00
- Example: 100 winning shares = $100 payout

## Gas Fees
- Claiming requires a transaction (gas fee)
- Consider batching claims if you have multiple
- Gas fees are separate from your winnings

## Example Scenario
**Market**: "Will ETH reach $5k by March?"
**Resolution**: YES
**Your Position**: 150 YES shares (bought for $90)
**Payout**: $150 (150 shares × $1)
**Profit**: $60 (minus gas fees)

## Losing Positions
- Shares on the losing outcome become worthless
- No action needed - they simply expire
- Loss is limited to your initial investment

## Important Notes
- Claims don't expire - claim anytime after resolution
- Multiple claims can be made in one transaction
- Unclaimed winnings remain in the contract
