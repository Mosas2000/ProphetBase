# Buying Shares

## Understanding Shares
Each market has two outcomes: **YES** and **NO**. You buy shares representing your prediction.

## How to Buy

### Step 1: Select a Market
Browse active markets and click on one you want to trade.

### Step 2: Choose Your Outcome
- Click **Buy YES** if you think the event will happen
- Click **Buy NO** if you think it won't happen

### Step 3: Enter Amount
Enter the amount of ETH/USDC you want to spend.

### Step 4: Review
- Check the number of shares you'll receive
- Review the current probability
- Confirm gas fees

### Step 5: Confirm Transaction
Click **Buy** and approve the transaction in your wallet.

## Pricing
Share prices are determined by the current market probability:
- If YES is at 60%, YES shares cost ~60¢ each
- If NO is at 40%, NO shares cost ~40¢ each

## Example
**Market**: "Will Bitcoin reach $100k by EOY?"
- Current probability: 65% YES / 35% NO
- You buy 100 YES shares for ~$65
- If outcome is YES, you receive $100 (100 shares × $1)
- Profit: $35

## Tips
- Buy when you disagree with the market probability
- Lower probability = higher potential returns
- Markets close at the resolution date
